This project makes reading & writing ID3 tags available to .Net applications.

It's currently based on .Net 3.5, using the ID3 v2.3 spec & written in C#.

A class diagram is available in the downloads. It's still very early for this project the library isn't really usable as such.

Please check back soon, or even offer some help or advice.
